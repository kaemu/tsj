### The Tower Today

The restoration of the Saint-Jacques Tower, carried out by the City of Paris between 2006 and 2013, aimed to preserve its architecture inherited from the 16th century. The facades, terrace, and statuary and ornamental decor were meticulously restored, to replace severely degraded stones, strengthening weakened ones, and reinstating elements essential to architectural coherence.

Today, the Saint-Jacques Tower holds a prominent place as one of the four starting points of the Way of Saint James (Camino de Santiago) in France. The Via Turonensis begins at its feet, linking to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, covering over 1000 kilometers. Recognized by UNESCO in 1998, it is listed as a World Heritage Site as part of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.

Every spring since its renovation, the city of Paris opens its doors to Parisians and visitors alike:

The Saint-Jacques Tower even enters school classrooms thanks to a strong desire to share this exceptional heritage with everyone. The public can visit the tower accompanied by a guide, but throughout its opening, exceptional events will be offered, such as photo workshops, and special evenings to discover the secrets of this exceptional monument differently and to explore its fascinating history (information available on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/toursaintjacques_paris) account).
