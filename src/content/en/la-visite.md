## Guided tour

Guided tour of the Saint-Jacques Tower, organized in small groups, immerses you in its fascinating past and allows you to discover its various uses over time as well as the illustrious figures who have shaped its history. Take part in the perilous climb of the monument's 300 steps, and you will be rewarded with a breathtaking view of the rooftops of Paris.
