## The Tower Saint-Jacques

### History

First documented in the 12th century and situated near the only bridges in Paris that crossed the Seine at that time, the Church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie stood at the heart of the district known as the Grande Boucherie, taking its name to distinguish it from the Church of Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas on the Left Bank. This church served as the burial place for notable parishioners, such as Nicolas Flamel, the famous Parisian bourgeois, who was interred there due to his considerable donations.

In 1509, the construction of a new bell tower in the flamboyant Gothic style began, funded by the powerful brotherhood of the butchers' district. Completed in 1523 under the direction of the architect Jean de Felin, the tower features many characteristic elements of this style such as flying buttresses, gargoyles, and slender pinnacles.

However, the Revolution drastically alters the history of the building. The church becomes national property and is sold as a stone quarry in 1797, with the condition that its bell tower, the tallest on the right bank, be preserved. It wasn't until 1836 that the City of Paris acquired the bell tower as part of a large urban development project aimed at expanding the city's east-west axis.

Thus, the tower has served various functions throughout the centuries. The renowned mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal conducted experiments on air pressure there between 1647 and 1648. It was also used for commercial purposes and transformed into a lead factory in the 1800s. Later, in 1885, the physicist Joseph Jaubert used the tower for meteorological experiments. Then, for much of the twentieth century, the tower continued to be useful to the community.

Under Napoleon III, in 1853, Baron Haussmann, prefect of the Seine, orchestrated a reorganization of services to implement major urban projects initiated during the Restoration and the July Monarchy. These initiatives, which began as early as the First Empire, aimed to modernize Paris by creating spacious boulevards, train stations, and green spaces, thus driving the transformation of the capital.

These extensive works profoundly transformed the history of the Saint-Jacques Tower, notably with the extension of Rue de Rivoli and the opening of Boulevard de Sébastopol, which intersect in front of the monument and its landscaped square. The square, specially designed to highlight the former Gothic bell tower, transformed into an ornamental tower under the direction of the architect Théodore Ballu. As early as 1862, this major transformation earned it protection as a historical monument.
